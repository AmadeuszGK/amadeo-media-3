After graduating from Wrocław University of Technology in 2017, I gained my first experience at one of the leading companies in the Polish gambling industry—Promatic. There, I worked on a platform for game presentation, promotional websites, and online games featuring personalities such as Mariusz Pudzianowski and Zenek Martyniuk. From 2020 to 2022, I was associated with Databout, where I developed the Databout Tools land analysis tool and an advanced application for public consultations (PPGIS). From 2022 to 2023, I worked at the largest IT company in Poland—Sii. During my time with Sii, I had the pleasure of working for the Norwegian company TU Media, a leader in providing technological content for a wide audience. Currently, I provide services for FedEx, an American company specializing in parcel shipping and logistics, where I am part of a team responsible for services such as the returns page, tracking page, and notifications.",
